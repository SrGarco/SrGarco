<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi there! I'm a <strong>Python developer</strong> with experience working with various frameworks and libraries. I'm also familiar with <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>, and enjoy exploring other programming languages.</p>

<p>Throughout my studies, I've gained a solid understanding of Python and its many libraries and frameworks, such as <strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>Django</strong>, and <strong>NumPy</strong>. I've used these tools to build a variety of applications, from web scrapers to data analysis tools.</p>

<p>I'm also comfortable working with <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> to create responsive, user-friendly interfaces for web applications. And when it comes to databases, I've worked extensively with <strong>SQL</strong> and <strong>NoSQL</strong> databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.</p>

<p>In my free time, I love exploring new technologies and experimenting with different programming languages. I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and contributing to <em>open source</em> projects.</p>
